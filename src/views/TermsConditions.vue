      </div>
      <p>
        a. The PLI Invoice/Receipt is non-negotiable and the Shipper acknowledges that it
        has been prepared by the Shipper or PLI on behalf of the Shipper. The Shipper
        warrants that it is the owner of the goods transported hereunder, or it is the
        authorized agent of the owner of the goods, and that it hereby accepts PLI’s terms
        and conditions for itself and as agent for and on behalf of any other person
        having an interest in the shipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. The Shippers warrants that each article in the shipment is properly described
        on this invoice and has not been declared by PLI to be unacceptable for transport
        and that the shipment is properly marked and addressed and packed to ensure safe
        transportation with ordinary care in handling. Shipper also warrants that it will
        not ship prohibited items or regulated items without a proper permit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Shipper hereby acknowledges that PLI may abandon and/or release any item
        consigned by the Shipper to the PLI which the latter has declared to be
        unacceptable or which the Shipper has undervalued for Customs’ purposes or
        misdescribed hereon, whether intentionally or otherwise, without incurring any
        liability whatsoever to the Shipper and the Shipper will save and defend,
        indemnity and hold PLI harmless from all claims, damages, lines, and expenses
        arising therefrom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Shipper shall be liable for all costs and expenses related to the shipment and
        for costs incurred in either returning the shipment to the Shipper or warehousing
        the shipment pending disposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of LCL or parcels, the shipper further warrants that the addressee can
        be found and identified by agents of PLI at the point of destination without
        extreme difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        If PLI is unable, after exercising due diligence to locate and identify the
        addressee of the cargo at the address indicated in the cargo box and shipping
        document, PLI shall notify the shipper of its inability to find the address. PLI
        shall also notify the Shipper of the location of the warehouse where the cargo is
        deposited. It shall then be the obligation of the Shipper to notify his/her
        addressee to claim the cargo at the Company’s designated warehouse. If the
        addressee does not claim the cargo at Company’s designated warehouse within six
        months from the attempted delivery at the address indicated in the cargo box,
        Company shall have the right to dispose of the cargo in any manner it deems
        reasonable to cover its costs.

        <h5>IV. CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS:</h5>
      </div>
      <p>
        a. Payment for Services. Customer, Shipper, and Consignee shall be jointly liable
        for all unpaid charges for services performed by PLI or agents. Customer
        authorizes PLI to charge its credit card directly for services rendered on the
        Customer’s behalf after departure by placing an order online, via fax, phone, or
        through a work order on site.
      </p>
      <p>

        arrangements have been made in advance. PLI has the right to require prepayment or
        guarantee of the charges at the time of request for Services. A failure to pay
        timely will result in the Customer having to pay in cash in advance for future
        services. PLI retains its right to hold Customers’ Goods for non-payment. If a
        credit card is provided to PLI, PLI has authorized to bill to such credit card any
        unpaid charges for services provided to the Customer, including charges for return
        shipping. Any charges not paid within 30 days of delivery will be subject to
        interest at 1 1/2% per month until paid.

      <p>
        c. Proper Description. Customer is obligated to disclose to PLI and Carrier if
        Customer’s packages contain items that are considered Hazardous Materials or
        Dangerous Goods. A customer has the obligation to ensure that each package is
        properly and completely described, is properly marked and addressed, and is
        packaged adequately to protect the contents during transportation. The customer
        must provide all documentation as required by the Bureau of Customs and hereby
        agrees to provide PLI and Carrier with accurate information in order to allow for
        all proper disclosures to be made on the Customer’s shipment. The customer is
        responsible for all placarding.

        hereunder and may refuse to surrender possession of the goods until such charges
        are paid. PLI has the right to hold shipper’s cargo until shipper shall have fully
        paid his/her obligation herein. If full payment has not been received within six
        months from the date of this contract, PLI has the right to dispose of the
        shipper’s cargo in any manner it deems reasonable to cover Shipper’s liabilities
        under this contract.
